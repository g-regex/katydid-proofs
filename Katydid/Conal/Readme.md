# ReProving Agda in Lean

In this subproject we are working on translating the paper [Symbolic and Automatic Differentiation of Languages - Conal Elliott](http://conal.net/papers/language-derivatives/paper.pdf) from Agda to LeanProver.

The goals of this project are to:

  - discover the differences between Agda and Lean
  - learn of different way to tackle proofs about derivatives of regular expressions
  - understand proofs and see if it is possible to not use too many tactics
